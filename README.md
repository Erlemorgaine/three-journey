# NOTES

- _Bounding Box_: Three js uses sphere bounding by default.

- _Frustum Culling_: It's about rendering / not rendering an object that is behind the camera.
  Three JS uses bounding box to calculate which objects are in camera view.

## Materials

- _Matcap_: You can find them on github and use them for matcap material, it's really cool. But check the license.
