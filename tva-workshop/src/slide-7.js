 * Texts
 *
 * - We struggled to find a way that works across all browsers and
 *   with everything we wanted (e.g. underline).
 * - HTML is (for now) difficult. In theory it's doable, but we have to
 *   figure it out better (it will be a formazione project).
 * - Most doable for now: blocks of text that can have variation
 *   between lines, but no variation within lines (e.g. no bold,
 *   italic etc)
 * - I also had problems with the font conversion, CO2.
